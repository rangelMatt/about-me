## Lab - 02: about-me-extend-game

Built a webpage to inform the user about myself while sharpening my JavaScript, CSS, and HTML skills. This included interacting with the user by prompting five questions and returning alerts.

____

## Lab - 03: about-me-extend-game

Created a couple more questions that utilizes `for...loop` and `while...loop`. This involved `if...else` statements as well as accessing an array.
____

## Lab - 04

Worked on Pair Programming in eachothers about-me files. We were able to excercise the pull function in github as well as eachother vocabularies and knowledge of coding.

Driver: Michael Maker
Navigator: Matt Rangel
We worked on encoding functions together.

____

## Lab - 05a,b,c

Worked on Git Branches, how to make them and switch in and out of them while merging to GitHub.

Finished and deployed `About Me` web page with some for loop functions and questions and answers about myself.

____

## Lab - 06

This lab involved setting a new code project based off of `Setting up a New 201 Code Project` template.

The Salmon Cookie project includes the below items:

1) 5 different cities

2) Each city contains open and close times

3) Each open and close times have total amount of cookies.

For this exercise we create objects with properties of city names, random functions to get random number of customers. A function that worked off of random number of customers to get random number of cookies.

We used helper functions to use up less code and lines, which helped the JS page look sleeker.

Most importantly, we implemented DOM to edit and add HTML code.

____

## Lab - 07

An extension from lab 06, with the same data, we created a table out and populated it with the city and cookie data. We did this by utilizing constructors and prototype functions

__

## Lab - 08a and 08b

Worked on HTML and CSS wire fram exercise by building a web page to mirror the one in the assignment using multiple elements. The elements included photo placement holders, a title, some writing that could be a description, and possible a button. These were placed in the header, body, and footer.

For part b, continued to work on salmon cookie exercise by working on the CSS styling and added some google fonts.

__

## Lab - 09

We worked on add a Form in our salmon cookies sales html page. It included asking for input that we would pass along into an eventListener in the javascript page. Which we then provided some code pulling data from the previous salmon cookie assignments, and then added into a row onto the table in the sales page populating the tables appropriately with cookies per hour for a desired city.

> ## Reflections and Comments

* This went really well! Albeit I had my own struggles today (family distractions), but that's life and I was able to continue on to complete a whole lab.
* I can't wait to touch on what I learned so far in Javascript into the webpages! Up until now, I was just typing code with no real goal. Now that I can see that the goal is actually pretty vast and will be tailored to whatever is required.
* I'm unsure of how long it took, because the distractions pulled me away at some interesting points. What I *completely* missed was writing the **wireframe**! I thought about it right around the tail end, and that would have helped me keep on track with so many distractions.
